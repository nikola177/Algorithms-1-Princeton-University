# Algorithms-1-Princeton-University

This course covers the essential information about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Also it covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.

Code for programming assignments from Algorithms Part I (https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-004).

Requires the stdlib.jar and algs4.jar to run, which can be retrieved from the course site.

## Week 1 - UnionFind / Percolation

* Percolation.java - A model for the percolation problem, determines if a 2d system of open / closed sites percolates from top to bottom.
* PercolationStats.java - Generates statistics using the percolation model.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_.
